# EP-statistic-radio-pulsars

To get pulsar data from ATNF catalog ( https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/), follow these steps:

- Select the required fields (Name, P0, S1400, Dist, Survey)
- To get pulsars only from the Parkes Multibeam Survey, add "survey(pmbs)" into the condition box.
- Click on Table to get the required data.

The data has been downloaded and stored as csv file (as can be found here). Running the Efron_Petrosian_Statistic.py file will render all plots.
